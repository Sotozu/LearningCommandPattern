/*
*READ ME*

I am using the term receiver/game-actor because the command pattern more generally applies to something that is a "receiver" (which is anything that takes a command)
and the game-actor part of the term is there because of its use in interactive objects in the game we wish to command as the player.

I am using the term function/method because new programmers who come from one line of education may use either term and in my experience was the cause of simple missunderstanding when reading documentation.
Function and method are the same thing.
